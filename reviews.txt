LOVED IT. FUNNIEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. There are so many scenes that are just classics and funny and when I go back to youtube, I end up watching multiple scenes again just to have a laugh. Everything was great. The story, the cast, the score, production, EVERYTHING. You need to watch this movie.

Genre: 
HORROR
Description: 
This movie focuses on the real-life character, Robert Graysmith who gives up his wife to focus on the Zodiac Investigation. There is a powerful scene at the end where Robert (Jake Gyllenhall) visits a store and where he believes the Zodiac Killer is employed in. They both stare at each other coldly and Robert leaves. Years later, a survivor identifies that employer that Robert visited as the Zodiac Killer. So many great scenes. Beautiful movie.

AMAZING MOVIE. HORRIBLE ENDING. If the movie ended 15 mins earlier it would've easily been a 4.5/5. The ending just made it even more sadder because bad people like Amy won at the end for the horrible things she did to her past relationships and her husband. Don't get me wrong, her husband cheated on her and pushed her but doesn't deserve an entire murder charge dropped on him. Horrible ending, would've been fun if we were to choose what will happen next instead of setting in reality that Amy won.

Description: 
No thank you. This does not represent the teenager experience or the high school experience. The premise is stupid and made it all about sex, have an additional element of comedy. Does not adapt The Scarlet Letter AT ALL except for one scene where she wears the letter "A" as a badge but I found it a stupid scene. Its a typicial high school movie where the premise is all about sex which gets very repetitive. I do not recommend this movie at all. The acting is the only reason im giving it a 1.2.
