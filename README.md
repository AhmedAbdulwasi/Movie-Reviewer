# Movie Reviewer
A Movie Reviewer which can sort movie reviews, register users, save reviews into a text file, read a text file, add reviews, etc. I recommend you try it and share your reviews with me and everyone who can see my GitHub page.

## Why?
To dive deeper into Java, specifically its classes, handling errors, I/Os, public methods, and the 4 pillars of OOP which are abstraction (interact without needing to know how it works), encapsulation (keep a class private and access it through public methods), Inheritance (inheriting existing classes), and polymorphism (use the same function for different meaning). 

Additionally, there was an Intro to Java course that I had to take this winter semester (CPS209) which explains why I haven't been active in Java for 3 months. Now I want to build upon that knowledge and take a proactive approach to my learning. Also, I had this idea of creating a program relating to movies for at least a year and never got to plan it since I've always been confused as to how it should be implemented. This project took about a week to finish. Enjoy!
